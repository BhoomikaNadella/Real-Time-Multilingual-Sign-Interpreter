#Real-Time Multilingual Sign Language Interpreter
This project provides a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter built with Python. The application utilizes a deep learning model with MediaPipe for high-fidelity hand landmark detection to translate static ASL gestures into text. A key feature is its multilingual support, providing output in English, Hindi, Kannada, and Marathi. The system is deployed as an accessible web application using the FlaskÂ framework.
